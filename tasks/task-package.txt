Task: Create a Go Package for Employee Management

Objective

Create a Go package named employee that manages employee details with restricted and unrestricted fields using struct visibility rules.

Requirements
	1.	Package Name: employee
	2.	Struct: Employee
	•	Unrestricted Field (Public):
	•	Name (string) → Employee’s name.
	•	Restricted Fields (Private):
	•	salary (float64) → Employee’s salary (cannot be accessed directly).
	•	id (int) → Employee ID (cannot be accessed directly).
	3.	Functions to Implement:
	•	NewEmployee(name string, id int, salary float64) *Employee
	•	Constructor to create a new Employee.
	•	Validate id (must be positive) and salary (must be non-negative).
	•	GetID() int
	•	Getter for id.
	•	GetSalary() float64
	•	Getter for salary.
	•	SetSalary(newSalary float64) error
	•	Setter for salary with validation (salary cannot be negative).
	4.	Create a main.go file to test the package
	•	Instantiate an Employee.
	•	Print Name using direct access.
	•	Print ID and Salary using getters.
	•	Update Salary using the setter.

Expected Output in main.go
	•	Print Employee name directly.
	•	Access Employee ID and Salary using getters.
	•	Update the Salary using the setter and validate the changes.

Submission Criteria

✅ Implement the employee package with proper struct and methods.
✅ Validate input data inside the NewEmployee function.
✅ Use getter and setter functions for restricted fields.
✅ Write a main.go file to test the package.

This task will help in understanding package creation, struct field visibility, encapsulation, and validation in Go. 🚀
